JavaScript Practice – Expense Tracker Learning Repo

This repo documents my journey learning JavaScript fundamentals while building toward a full-stack Expense Tracker app. I'm following a deep, slow-paced learning path focused on mastering concepts thoroughly before moving to backend and frontend development.

This is not a tutorial project—this is a **learning sandbox**. Every file here represents an intentional step in understanding how real web app logic is built from scratch.
